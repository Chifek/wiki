====== Ghost on NodeJS ======


===== Install Ghost-CLI =====


''npm install ghost-cli@latest -g''



===== Install Ghost =====

In your terminal, cd into an empty directory and run the install command:

''ghost install local''

Once the install is finished you’ll be able to access your new site on http://localhost:2368 and http://localhost:2368/ghost to access Ghost Admin



**That’s it! You’re done.**

  * Your publication is setup in ''development'' mode with less caching
  * The SQLite3 database is auto-setup and located in ''/content/data/''
  * Logs only go to ''stdout''


===== Starting & Stopping =====

Ghost runs in a separate background process and remains running until you stop it or restart your computer. So you may find these commands useful for taming it:

  * ''ghost stop'' to stop Ghost
  * ''ghost start'' to start Ghost
  * ''ghost log'' views logs
  * ''ghost ls'' to list all running Ghost blogs

Run ''ghost help'' for a list of available commands, or explore the full Ghost-CLI documentation.
