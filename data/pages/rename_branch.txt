Try to disable the branch protection in the settings/repository page. Check the sections Default Branch and Protected Branches

After that:

Checkout the branch locally.
<code>git checkout branch</code>
Rename it locally
<code>git checkout -b branch_old</code>
delete remote branch
<code>git push --delete origin branch</code>
push the locally renamed branch to remote.
<code>git push --set-upstream origin branch_old</code>
