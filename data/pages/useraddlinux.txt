How to Create a New User in Linux #
To create a new user account, invoke the useradd command followed by the name of the user.

For example to create a new user named username you would run:

''sudo useradd -m username''


The command adds an entry to the /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group and /etc/gshadow files.

To be able to log in as the newly created user, you need to set the user password. To do that run the passwd command followed by the username:

''sudo passwd username''


DELETE USER

''userdel -r userName''
