<p>
Try to disable the branch protection in the settings/repository page. Check the sections Default Branch and Protected Branches
</p>

<p>
After that:
</p>

<p>
Checkout the branch locally.
</p>
<pre class="code">git checkout branch</pre>

<p>
Rename it locally
</p>
<pre class="code">git checkout -b branch_old</pre>

<p>
delete remote branch
</p>
<pre class="code">git push --delete origin branch</pre>

<p>
push the locally renamed branch to remote.
</p>
<pre class="code">git push --set-upstream origin branch_old</pre>

<p>
Git makes managing branches really easy - and deleting local branches is no exception:
</p>
<pre class="code">git branch -d &lt;local-branch&gt;</pre>

<p>
In some cases, Git might refuse to delete your local branch: when it contains commits that haven&#039;t been merged into any other local branches or pushed to a remote repository. This is a very sensible rule that protects you from inadvertently losing commit data.
</p>

<p>
If you want to delete such a branch nonetheless (e.g. because you&#039;ve programmed yourself into a dead end and produced commits that aren&#039;t worth keeping) you can do so with the «-D» flag:
</p>
<pre class="code">git branch -D &lt;local-branch&gt;</pre>
