How to Create a New User in Linux #
To create a new user account, invoke the useradd command followed by the name of the user.
</p>

<p>
For example to create a new user named username you would run:
</p>

<p>
<code>sudo useradd -m username</code>
</p>

<p>
The command adds an entry to the /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group and /etc/gshadow files.
</p>

<p>
To be able to log in as the newly created user, you need to set the user password. To do that run the passwd command followed by the username:
</p>

<p>
<code>sudo passwd username</code>
</p>

<p>
DELETE USER
</p>

<p>
<code>userdel -r userName</code>
</p>
