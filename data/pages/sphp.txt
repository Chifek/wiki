====== Switch between PHP versions in Mac with Homebrew & sphp ======


Many times I found me in the scenario where I need to use different versions for PHP at the same time for different projects. So here is a tiny guide of how to do this in the easy way.

First install different versions for php using Homebrew (If you haven’t installed Homebrew, just follow the at https://brew.sh/), to install this use:

<code>
brew install php@7.1
brew install php@7.2
brew install php@7.3
brew install php@7.4
</code>


Now you have to install sphp, you can do this with this script:


''curl -L https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rhukster/f4c04f1bf59e0b74e335ee5d186a98e2/raw > /usr/local/bin/sphp''

Once it is downloaded in your computer just make it executable:

''chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sphp''

Cool, now restart your terminal and try to switch between versions with

''sphp 7.4''

<code>
Switching to php@7.4
Switching your shell

Unlinking /usr/local/Cellar/php@7.0/7.0.30… 0 symlinks removed
Unlinking /usr/local/Cellar/php@7.1/7.1.32_1… 0 symlinks removed
Unlinking /usr/local/Cellar/php@7.2/7.2.30_1… 0 symlinks removed
Unlinking /usr/local/Cellar/php@7.3/7.3.18… 25 symlinks removed
Unlinking /usr/local/Cellar/php/7.4.6… 0 symlinks removed
Linking /usr/local/Cellar/php/7.4.6… 24 symlinks created
You will need sudo power from now on
</code>

Test your php version:

<code>
php --version

PHP 7.4.6 (cli) (built: May 14 2020 10:40:11) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.4.0, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
    with Zend OPcache v7.4.6, Copyright (c), by Zend Technologies</code>

I will be updating this article if I found some issues and some other troubleshooting tips.

===== Troubleshooting =====


If the php version has not changed check first where does your php executable came from with, to work it should show something like this:

<code>
which php
/usr/local/bin/php
</code>

Check your ~/.bash_profile to be sure there no other php version loading after sphp. If there is some PHP loading just comment it, and restart your Terminal.
